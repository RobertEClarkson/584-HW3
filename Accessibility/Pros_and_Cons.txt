Tool used: Chrome devtools lighthouse.

Canvas: accessibility is very high. Buttons are clear and readable. Only problem found is that apparently a list on the assignment page raises this message: "Lists do not contain only <li> elements and script supporting elements (<script> and <template>)." This might cause screen reading issues according to the tool.


My page: Accessibility is fine for what it is at this point. Biggest problems brought up by the tool are: background image doesn't have enough color contrast (could be difficult to read), <title> missing, and no main landmark.
